    <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Evan Xiang, and I'm thrilled that you're here. I'm a 11th grader who loves molecular biology, ethology, and understanding the world around us.</p>
    <p>I love engaging in these interests through several competitions such as the USA Biology Olympiad (USABO), Science Olympiad, and the USA Earth Science Olympiad (USESO). I firmly believe that participation in these olympiads has solidified my love for the natural sciences. I was a 2024 USA Biology Olympiad National Finalist (Top 20) and a 2024 USA Earth Science Olympiad National Finalist (Top 40). In Science Olympiad, I have been a team captain since 7th grade, leading the MS team to 2 national tournaments by placing Top 2 at the PA State Tournament. In HS, I have led the team from a 20th place finish in 2023 to 8th in 2024. SciOly truly is what got me started in science in the first place, and though I sometimes feel stressed by it, it is something I truly love. </p>
    <p>I'm most interested in the intersection of evolutionary biology and neuroscience, specifically how the neural circuits that govern our core motor functions have evolved from the earliest common ancestors of modern life to the now prevalent H. Sapiens. </p>
    <p>I also have a keen interest in Meteorology, having competed in the SciOly event for 4 years (won states 3 times in a row from 7th-9th!). I love being able to look at some clouds in the sky, combining with patterns, and being able to semi-accurately predict the weather (emphasis on semi).</p>
    <p>I volunteer my time by teaching classes to those starting in Meteorology and the USABO through Pandorax and private tutoring. I also write SciOly tests about Microbiology, Meteorology, and Experimental Design, having written for 20+ invitationals in my time. My tests have been taken by over 3500 students, and I have graded over 2000. </p>
    <p>Finally, outside of the sciences, I enjoy playing table tennis with my parents (I'm better... just kidding), watching meteor showers, trolling in voice chat with my friends, and engaging in the remainder of the academic ratrace.</p>
