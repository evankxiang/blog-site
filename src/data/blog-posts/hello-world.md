# <a name="What"></a>What is the USABO?

USABO or the USA Biolympiad is a biology competition sponsored by the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE). The tests go through 4 levels, starting with the open exam, then semifinal exam, national finals, and selection to the USA Biology Team. Over 12,000+ students compete in the open exam with 10% qualifying for the semifinal exam. Finally, the top 20 semifinalists are invited to the USABO National Finals/Training Camp, which is a 2 week all-expenses-paid program used to prepare the finalists for the theoretical and practical concluding exams. The Top 4 Finalists are selected to represent the United States at the International Biology Olympiad (IBO), which is held in various countries across the world. 

STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
